## Real-time SDR for mono/stereo FM and RDS

The main objective of the project is to navigate a complex speciÔ¨Åcation and to develop the understanding for the challenges that must be addressed for a real-time implementation of a computing system that operates in a form factor-constrained environment. 

The project description is available in the project [document](doc/3dy4-project-2022.pdf).

All the source code for the project must be submitted before the end of March 31. The project cross-examinations and oral presentations will run in the week of April 4 and the detailed final project report is due on April 8.
